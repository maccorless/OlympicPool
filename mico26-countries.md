## Notes for Admin

1. **Host Nation**: Italy may outperform Beijing 2022 (24 pts). Current cost of 20 could be undervalued.

2. **Netherlands Risk**: Their 38 points came heavily from speed skating. High variance sport.

3. **China Note**: Their 37 points in Beijing included home advantage. May regress in Italy.

4. **NHL Factor**: With NHL players participating in 2026, hockey results may shift. USA, Canada, Sweden, Finland could see changes.

5. **Longshot Strategy**: With 10 picks and $1 minimum cost, players can include several lottery tickets hoping for surprise medals.

6. **Budget Math**: Total cost of all scoring countries (27) = 544. Budget of 200 means players can afford roughly 37% of available medal points.
